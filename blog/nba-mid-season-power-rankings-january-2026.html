                            We’re officially past the halfway point of the 2025-26 NBA season, and what a ride it’s been. The Oklahoma City Thunder continue to look unstoppable, the Celtics are quietly reloading, and a few surprise teams have crashed the contender party. As a lifelong basketball fan who’s followed the league through every era, I’ve crunched the numbers, watched the games, and factored in schedule strength, injuries, and momentum to bring you my mid-season power rankings.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These aren’t just based on record — net rating, defensive efficiency, clutch performance, and eye test all play a role. Let’s break down the real title contenders as we head into the second half.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#1. Oklahoma City Thunder</h2>
                        <p>
                            Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is playing at an MVP level, Chet Holmgren has taken another leap on both ends, and Lu Dort remains the league’s premier perimeter pest. OKC’s defense is suffocating, their pace is relentless, and their depth is scary. They’ve beaten every top team at least once already. Personal take: This is the most complete Thunder team since the Durant-Westbrook days — and they’re only getting better.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#2. Boston Celtics</h2>
                        <p>
                            Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are in peak form, Kristaps Porziņģis is healthy (finally), and Joe Mazzulla’s offense is humming. The addition of Jrue Holiday last season is still paying dividends. They might not have the Thunder’s record, but their ceiling in a seven-game series feels unmatched when fully locked in.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#3. Cleveland Cavaliers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland are cooking, Evan Mobley is a Defensive Player of the Year candidate, and Kenny Atkinson has unlocked their offense. The Cavs have the league’s best record so far and look legit. The only question: Can they stay healthy in the playoffs?
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#4. Denver Nuggets</h2>
                        <p>
                            Nikola Jokić is doing Nikola Jokić things — triple-doubles for fun, impossible passes, and carrying the offense. Jamal Murray looks fully back from injury, and their role players are stepping up. Classic Nuggets: Quietly excellent, waiting to flip the switch in spring.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#5. New York Knicks</h2>
                        <p>
                            Karl-Anthony Towns has been a revelation alongside Jalen Brunson, OG Anunoby is locking down wings, and Tom Thibodeau’s defense is elite again. Madison Square Garden is rocking. They’re deep, physical, and hungry — a real threat in the East.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#6. Milwaukee Bucks</h2>
                        <p>
                            Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a force of nature, Damian Lillard is finding his groove under Doc Rivers, and Khris Middleton is rounding into form. When healthy, they’re still one of the scariest teams in a playoff series.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#7. Minnesota Timberwolves</h2>
                        <p>
                            Anthony Edwards is ascending into superstardom, Rudy Gobert anchors the defense, and Julius Randle has added scoring punch. They’re figuring out the new pieces and could be dangerous come playoff time.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#8. Los Angeles Lakers</h2>
                        <p>
                            LeBron James (still defying Father Time) and Anthony Davis are carrying the load, with strong supporting play from Austin Reaves and rookie Dalton Knecht. JJ Redick’s coaching has brought better spacing and pace. Dark horse contender if they stay healthy.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#9. Dallas Mavericks</h2>
                        <p>
                            Luka Dončić is putting up video game numbers, Klay Thompson is finding his rhythm, and Kyrie Irving is healthy. The defense has improved with new additions. They’re built for playoff runs — never count them out.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="pixelated-text">#10. Philadelphia 76ers</h2>
                        <p>
                            Joel Embiid is dominant when on the court, Tyrese Maxey is emerging as a star, and Paul George adds versatility. Injuries have hurt them early, but a healthy Sixers team in April is terrifying for anyone.
                        </p>
