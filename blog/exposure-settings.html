    <h3>Optimal Exposure Settings</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog/exposure-settings-real-estate-photos-pro-tips" target="_blank">guide</a> recommended using a low ISO (100-200) and f/8 aperture for sharp, well-lit interiors.

    <h3>Bracketing for HDR</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog" target="_blank">blog</a> advised shooting bracketed exposures (-2, 0, +2 EV) for HDR blending.
