    <h2>Understanding Color Correction vs. Color Grading</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog/color-grading-vs-color-correction-real-estate" target="_blank">Photoandvideoedits.com guide</a> breaks down these essential techniques for real estate photography.</p>
    <h3>Color Correction: The Foundation</h3>
    <p>Color correction, as explained by <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/" target="_blank">Photoandvideoedits.com</a>, adjusts images to reflect true-to-life colors, fixing issues like color casts or uneven lighting. For example, I corrected a yellowish tint in a living room photo caused by indoor bulbs, ensuring walls appeared white and furniture colors accurate. This process involves tweaking exposure, white balance, and contrast to make photos look natural, as if buyers were viewing the property in person.</p>[](https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog/color-correction-and-grading-techniques-in-real-estate-photo-editing)
    <h3>Color Grading: The Creative Touch</h3>
    <p>Color grading, per the <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog/color-grading-vs-color-correction-real-estate" target="_blank">guide</a>, enhances the mood by adjusting hues and tones. I used grading to add warm tones to a cozy bedroom, making it more inviting. This artistic step, supported by <a href="https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog" target="_blank">Photoandvideoedits.com’s blog</a>, helps evoke emotions that attract buyers while keeping the image realistic.</p>[](https://www.photoandvideoedits.com/blog/color-correction-and-grading-techniques-in-real-estate-photo-editing)
